Doing research, I've been researching for about 5-6 hours now and i came to a conclusion - I am going to use hybrid oxidising motor to power my rocket as i can control them and make them work the way I want. I am locking in paraffin wax and n2o chargers for the fuel for now. I am gonna use whipped cream chargers as they suit the requirements here. Other than that I am right now studying how solenoid valves work and how can I effectively use them. Packing up for today - Its 4am.
